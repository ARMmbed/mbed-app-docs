#Getting Started

Looking to get started quickly? Youâ€™ll need a smartphone, a web browser, and a development board that supports both BLE and mbed OS [BLE APIs](http://docs.mbed.org/docs/ble-intros/en/latest/). Follow these simple instructions to run one of our demo applications:

1. Download the [mbed Provisioning app](faqs.md#how-do-i-get-the-app) to your smartphone.
2. Compile and flash a [demo application](https://github.com/ARMmbed/voytalk-hello-mbed) onto your chosen development board.
3. Open up the mbed Provisioning App and select the device from the list. Follow the instructions in the app.
4. Let us know what you think!


Alternatively, to get to know how to use the mbed Provisioing App in detail, here's a good place to start:
