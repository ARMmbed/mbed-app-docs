#Getting Started

Looking to get started quickly? You’ll need a smartphone, a web browser, and a development board that supports both BLE and mbed OS [BLE APIs](http://docs.mbed.org/docs/ble-intros/en/latest/). Follow these simple instructions to run one of our demo applications:

1. Download the [Envoy app](/faqs/#how-do-i-get-the-envoy-app) to your smartphone.
2. Compile and flash a demo application [LINK TO DEMOS] onto your chosen development board.
3. Open up Envoy and select the device from the list. Follow the instructions in the app.
4. Let us know what you think!


Alternatively, to get ot know Envoy in detail, here's a good place to start:
