The Interaction Flow

[FLOW DIAGRAM HERE]

When a device has some configuration that the user may change, it starts to advertise its presence to surrounding Envoys. These advertisements detail the type of configuration that the device wants, and the permissions that an Envoy must have to change the configuration.

If an Envoy determines that it has the right set of permissions and the user is interested in changing the configuration of the device, it offers an appropriate interface to the user to edit the settings. Once the user is happy with the settings the Envoy saves the new configuration to the device.
