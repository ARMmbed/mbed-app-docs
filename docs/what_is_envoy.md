# What is Envoy?

*en·voy* – “accredited messenger or representative.”

Envoy is your representative in the digital world; your personal assistant in the business of device interactions; your filter on attention seeking technology. Envoy lets you focus on what’s important.

Devices, whether connected or not, usually require configuration to make them work. This configuration process can present a real challenge for users that are less confident with technology, and is a recurring annoyance for those that are. Today, each product implements a different system, with a different user interface, using different conventions, different button combinations, with different flashing lights and different bleeps. This is bad for users, constraining for designers and complex for developers. We can do better.

Envoy provides a simple, flexible system for a device to ask for input from the user. The same simple system can be reused between different devices from different manufacturers ensuring the same conventions and the same experience across all of a user's devices. It eliminates re-entry of common data such as WiFi credentials. We think this creates a great user experience and makes more products more accessible to more people.


### What do I need to use Envoy in my product?

Envoy uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to communicate configuration information from a smartphone, tablet or wearable device to a device that needs configuration. This means that to use Envoy to set up your product you need to make sure BLE is designed in. Envoy provides a set of libraries for use with mbed OS to make building connected devices fast and scalable.

### What do my customers need to use Envoy?

Your users will need to have the Envoy application installed on their smartphone or tablet. The Envoy application is available for free from the Apple App Store [LINK].
