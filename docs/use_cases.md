# Example Use Cases

## WiFi Configuration

A simple example of configuration data that is often required during the setup of a new device is WiFi credentials. Typing in details repeatedly, and the struggle to remember the right password, are familiar to most people.

The action of joining a WiFi network typically requires two pieces of information:

ssid - the name of the network that should be joined.
key - the ‘password’ to access the network. 

Using Envoy can simplify this process, making the selection and authentication of preferred WiFi networks as simple as a tap from a list of options. Using Envoy enables reuse of previously entered credentials, to avoid re-entry when configuring new devices for the same network.

## Complex Configuration

Configuring WiFi is great - but for most products that’s not enough. That’s why Envoy allows you to define the configuration details that you need from your users. 

Using an extensible constraint-based system, you can efficiently describe the details you need, including data types, formats, minimum and maximum values and nesting of properties. Envoy will then deal with displaying an appropriate user interface and remembering values for reuse later on.
